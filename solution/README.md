# How to Solve the Challenge?

Ghidra is a useful tool to solve this challenge. Extracting the assembly instruction sequence the artifact with this tool reveals one suspicious element. This element is an eight-bit multiplication. The executable multiplies factors such that the resulting product cannot an eight-bit value. This size mismatch may direct participants to modify the suspicious instruction. Such a modification could directly substitute the problematic instruction with the corresponding thirty-two-bit variant. The first byte of the eight-bit variant of the unsigned multiply instruction is 0xF6. Replacing this byte with the value 0xF7 converts this instruction to its thirty-two-bit counterpart. This change would make the executable not overflow bits for the products it calculates. As such, it can print the resulting products in ASCII form. This behaviour would cause the flag to appear, thus solving the challenge.
